PEDAL TO THE METAL

Genre -- Racing/Driving Game
TITAN -- Jason Pham, Albert Bastakoti, Eric Misiak, Nathan Smith

Pedal to the Metal is a high-octane, chaotic-inducing, and comically intense 2D racing/driving game in which the player takes on the role of a bank robber on the run from police pursuit. The player must surf through traffic, blast through obstacles, and survive the endless highway while trying to get the highest score. The core idea of this game is to outrun the law in a dangerous and unpredictable highway environment. The game is all about speed, risk, chaos, and survival â€” all wrapped in a playful, cartoonish art style. What would make this game exciting and unique are the dynamic traffic and obstacles spawner system to create challenge and conflict, the in-game news commentary from a helicopter camera to add humor and immersive storytelling, and the Passenger Princess Co-Op mode where one player drives while the other shoots from the car.

Using Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow keys on the keyboard, you will survive and endure the chaotic highway filled with a variety of obstacles. The ultimate goal of this game is to rack up the highest score. When you pick up the Rocket power-up, you press the 'Space' key to shoot in front of your direction. When it hits a blue car obstacle, it destroys it on collision. Note: you can only hold up to 1 Rocket, meaning you cannot stack power-ups.
